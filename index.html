<p class="intro">
  When the iPhone X launched in early November I was less gobsmacked by the gimmicky additions the tech giant had made to catapult their flagship phone to the top of everyone’s Christmas wish lists than the price to buy all of the parts that comprise the phone..

</p>

<p>
Less than a week after its release, IHS Markit, a London-based analysis firm <a href="https://technology.ihs.com/595738/ihs-markit-teardown-reveals-what-higher-apple-iphone-8-plus-cost-actually-buys">released a report</a> on the bill of materials for the iPhone X. The total price for the parts that go into the £999 phone was revealed at a shocking £280, leaving myself and others bewildered at the ridiculous mark-up.
</p>

<p>
But can we realistically expect our lives to be much better should we choose to boycott iPhones? I haven’t been a day without an iPhone since the morning after I drunkenly donated a perfectly good 5S to Sheffield’s finest taxi seat, but I wondered how difficult it could really be to live my life in its current state without one, for one day.
</p>
<h3>Early morning shopping</h3>

<p>
  Christmas has just passed and as I’m an only child, the only one in my family that can ensure another generation of Jones’s graces the planet I naturally did pretty well over the holidays, money-wise. It’s a sort of ‘spoil me, or else’ deal I have with my relatives. Leverage is everything.
</p>
<p>
Normally when shopping for clothes I would consult my mum via Snapchat for her general opinion and approval. Channelling my inner year 8 school girl, I headed straight to the fitting rooms armed with Topman’s finest and a DSLR I hired from my University, I went to take the highest quality mirror selfies ever. One drawback of the DSLR is that they’re quite noisy compared to the shutter sound on a phone, I imagine the staff outside the fitting rooms were confused.</p>

<p>
Photoshoot over and I needed a hotspot to send over the JPEGs in an email. I arrived at the nearby Costa, bought a shortbread for the price of a decent footlong at Subway and pulled out my Macbook Pro from my bag, packed with outdated tech. Frustratingly, I soon realised that my Macbook has no SD card slots. Admitting defeat, I packed up my bag and decided to abandon the shopping.</p>

<p>

<h3> Killing time</h3>

<p>
Anyone who has been to a town centre before knows the feeling of unadulterated anguish at the thought of being stopped by someone trying to sell you something. The British are too polite of a people to just walk past and ignore them. We must rehearse our chosen line 100 yards in advance, plan a tactical route by one of them already engaged in conversation or do what most other people do, plug in some headphones.
</p>

<p>
Without a device to connect to Spotify, earlier I dug out an old Sony Walkman and the last CD I bought, AM by Arctic Monkeys, in anticipation of this very moment.
</p>

<p>
It’s not practical, nor is it stylish or comfortable on my bony pelvis, but Alex Turner still sounded as heavenly as he does on any streaming service and I snubbed an overly smiley NSPCC marketer with confidence and ease.
</p>

<h3>Procrastination</h3>
<p>
Town centre successfully tackled, I reached my library for a few hours of studying. Anyone who has any level of education knows that you need to take study breaks, even when you don’t actually need to. Usually in this scenario I would play a game of Miniclip’s 8-ball pool on my phone but with no access to that I resorted to my housemate, Ben’s Nintendo DS that I swiped form the living room earlier in the day.
</p>
<p>
Pokémon was the cartridge inserted and his progress was ripe to be halted by my complete inexperience with the game. I ended up stumbling into Slowpoke Well where I was confronted by four Rocket Grunts and with no healthy Pokémon in my arsenal, I was swiftly downed by some Rattatas.
</p>
<h3>Operation Casanova</h3>
<p>
I have thus far clumsily managed to survive my day without my iPhone although it has taken some adaptation. The last app I would usually use in a day is Tinder. The beauty of it is that unlike any other forms of modern-day courtship, I can exercise my wit and confidence from the comfort of my toilet seat. Without an iPhone I had to resort to the far more primitive method of approaching a woman in the street and asking for a date, a skill of mine that has gone unused since my time as a youngster at under-16 events at Brazillias Nightclub.
</p>
<p>
After the second scoff at my advances, it seemed that my game had not improved in the seven years between now and when I was fifteen. Apparently the ‘did it hurt...’ line doesn’t have the same sarcastic, boyish charm that it does over a new match. Perhaps women are now too accustomed to being courted online that a sober approach in person seems weird. Perhaps it was the clear wavering in my voice or the nervous river of sweat gushing through my brow that spoilt my chances.

<p>
Honestly, the line worked twice. Maybe it was pity, maybe I got the delivery right or maybe they just saw the funny side of things, but this is one thing on a phone I can actually live without.
</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Just like it was in 2006, life is possible without an iPhone but it’s easy to see how Apple’s flagship product streamlines our everyday life. In the information age, sharing has never been easier since the advent of the smartphone.
</p>

<p>Is that enough of an argument to warrant a 300% profit margin on every iPhone X? It’s your decision entirely however many of those under Apple’s spell, myself included, have adapted to a life with a device that makes the life of its beholder much easier. If anything, the iPhone must be praised as an enabler of spontaneity. Checking what’s on at the cinema, making a table reservation and even checking the weather are all underappreciated little conveniences the iPhone offers us. In a world where the currency everyone is talking about isn’t even tangible, an iPhone makes the world a little easier to navigate.
